    <p>
        Scrabble is a classic word game where players score points by forming words from
        individual letter tiles on a game board.<br>Each letter tile has a point value, 
        and players arrange these tiles on a 15x15
        grid to create words, much like a crossword puzzle.<br>The goal is to score the most points 
        by creating high-scoring words,
        often by taking advantage of bonus squares on the board 
        (like double or triple letter/word scores).
        <br>The game combines vocabulary, strategy, and sometimes luck with the letter tiles drawn.

        <p class="p">Here is a detailed tutorial for the game.</p>
         <h3>Board layuot</h3>
            <ul>
                    <li>TW (Triple Word): When a word covers a square marked "TW," the total score of the word is tripled. 
                    If you place a word that covers more than one TW square, the score is multiplied by 9 (3x3).</li>
                    <li>DW (Double Word): If a word covers a "DW" square, the total score of the word is doubled. 
                    If a word lands on two DW squares, the score is multiplied by 4 (2x2).</li>
                    <li>DL (Double Letter): When a letter is placed on a "DL" square, the value of that letter is doubled. 
                    Only the individual letter score is doubled, not the entire word.</li>
                    <li>TL (Triple Letter): If a letter lands on a "TL" square, the value of that letter is tripled. 
                    Again, only the letter score is tripled, not the entire word.</li>
                    <li>Center star: The center star  is where the first word of the game must be placed. 
                    .</li>
            </ul>

    <div id="row" class="row"></div>

        <h3>STEP 1</h3>
        <p>
            
            Have each player one tile out of the tile bag, The player that gets the letter   closest to the letter “A”<br> goes first>each player then draws seven tiles from the tile bag.
            The first player begins the game by placing a word on the star square at the centre of  the board ,<br>either horizontally or vertically.
            This star acts as a double-word score.
        </p>

<h3>STEP 2</h3>
<p>
Tally each word score by adding point values for each letter in the word point values range from 0 points for a blank tile to 10 points for <br>
the letters a paper and a pen to keep track of the word scores for each player.
Some squares on the board allow youto multiply the tiles valeby two or three.
</p>

<h3>STEP 3</h3>


<p> 
Continue playing in a counterclockwise direction around the board. During each turn , a player can decide to place a word on the board, <br>
Sexchange tiles,or pass. If a player decides to exchange tiles, replace them with an equivalent number from the tile bag. 
If they choose this option, they cannot do anything else on that turn.
</p>

<h3>STEP 4</h3>
<p>
After placing a word on the board, draw an equal number of new tiles from the tile bag  so that each player always has seven tiles.
</p>

<h3>STEP 5</h3>

<p>Continue playing. All letters played must touch at least one letter that is already on the board to form at least one complete word. <br>
When one player has used all of their tiles or no one can make any more words, the game ends. If a player uses all seven of their tiles in one turn, <br>
they add a 50-point bonus to their word score.
</p>

<h3>STEP 6</h3>

<p>Consult a dictionary only if you’re challenging another player’s word. If the word isn’t in <br>
the dictioanary, the player losestheir turn. If the word is allowed, the challenger loses their turn.
</p>
<h3>STEP 7</h3>

<p>Calculate each player’s final score by adding up the points from all of their word scores. <br>
Then, subtract the sum of their unplayed letters. If one player has used up all of their letters, <br>
add the sum of everyone else’s unplayed letters to their score.
The player with the highest score wins.
